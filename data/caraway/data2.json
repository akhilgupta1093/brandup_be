        "review": "Firm believer that that things can be both aesthetic and functional, and that romanticizing the little, everyday things makes life more fun. So here is me doing the dishes with my favorite @doraihome dish pads on the counter and the morning sunlight streaming in through the sun tunnel ‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nI purchased the dorai dish pad last year after getting fed up with the mold and mildew that had taken up a permanent residence on our old dish rack, and we loved it so much that we ended up buying another one. The fact that they dry instantly (meaning no more mold and mildew) has been a game changer for us, and we love that they‚Äôre collapsible so we can fold them up when not in use. We were already big fans of dorai, so I was super excited when they reached out about trying their newest addition: the dish pad rack (g i f t e d). We wash a lot of dishes by hand, so I have been loving all of the extra space that this rack frees up on the dish pads. I also love that it‚Äôs open on the bottom, so water slides right down onto dish pad and dries instantly. \n\nIf you love your dorai dish pad, you‚Äôll definitely love this new addition, and you can use the code STAYHOMESTYLE15 to save 15% off your order!\n.\n.\n.\n#dorai #doraihome #doraidishrack #doraidishpad #fable #dinewithfable #fabledinnerware #carawayhome #caraway #carawaycookware #carawayambassador #cutco #cutcoknives #cutcochefknife #amazonhome #amazonfashion #dishrack #romanticizeyourlife #smmakelifebeautiful #cljsquad #deltafaucet #loweshomeimprovement #anthropologie #anthroliving #quartzcountertops #samsungtheframe #samsungframetv #kitchenisland"
